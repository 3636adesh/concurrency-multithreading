ðŸ”¥ Tough Java Concurrency Questions :-
What are the differences between synchronized, Lock, and ReentrantLock? When would you prefer one over the other?

Explain how the Java Memory Model (JMM) works. What role does volatile play?

What are the problems with thread safety in singleton patterns, and how can you fix them?

What is the difference between wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()? When would you use them?

Explain deadlock, livelock, and starvation. How would you prevent each in a multi-threaded application?

What is false sharing and how does it affect performance?

How does the ThreadLocal class work? What are the pitfalls in using it in a Spring Boot application?

What are the advantages of using a ThreadPoolExecutor instead of manually creating threads?

What is the Fork/Join framework? How is it different from an ExecutorService?

Explain the role of CompletableFuture and its methods like thenApply, thenCombine, exceptionally, etc.

ðŸ’» Tough Spring Boot Concurrency Coding Challenges
1. Async REST API
Build a Spring Boot API that accepts a request and processes it asynchronously using @Async and CompletableFuture.

Log request start and end timestamps

Handle exceptions without blocking the main thread

Return 202 Accepted immediately and poll for the result

2. Custom Thread Pool Executor in Spring Boot
Implement your own ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean and use it in an @Async service method. Control:

Core pool size

Max pool size

Queue capacity

Rejection policy

3. Banking Transaction Simulation
Simulate multiple users transferring money concurrently between accounts.

Ensure consistency with ReentrantLock

Prevent deadlocks by ordering locks properly

Add stress test with 1000+ transfers

4. Rate Limiting API
Implement a rate limiter using Semaphore or AtomicInteger.

Limit max 5 requests per second per user

Reset counter using a scheduled executor

5. Concurrent Cache Invalidation
Design a shared cache that refreshes every 5 seconds and can be safely accessed by multiple threads.

Use ConcurrentHashMap and ReadWriteLock

Allow readers to access stale data while write is updating cache

6. Thread Leak Detection
Create a task scheduler that runs background tasks. Intentionally cause a thread leak and write a monitor to detect it using:

Thread count monitor

Dead thread detection via Thread.getState()
